Developed a comprehensive IoT-based smart agriculture system for monitoring and maintaining optimal growing conditions for cucumber plants, using the ESP32 microcontroller. The system integrates a wide range of sensors for real-time environmental and system status monitoring:

DHT22 – Air temperature and humidity

DS18B20 – Soil temperature

Soil Moisture Sensor – Soil water content

TDS Sensor – Water quality monitoring

Water Temperature Sensor – Irrigation water temperature

Ultrasonic Sensor – Water tank level measurement

LDR Sensor – Automated lighting based on ambient light

PIR Motion Sensor – Intrusion detection for garden security

The system uses the Blynk platform to provide remote monitoring and control via a mobile app. It supports automated watering when soil moisture falls below a threshold and automatic lighting when light levels are low. All sensor data is logged to Google Sheets for tracking historical trends and analysis.

This project demonstrates strong skills in IoT development, sensor interfacing, automation, real-time cloud monitoring, and data logging, with practical applications in smart farming, environmental monitoring, and agricultural security.
